Introducing News Hub - Your Daily Source for News :slightly_smiling_face:

News Hub is a dynamic and user-friendly React-based website that brings you the latest news from around the world. With an intuitive user interface and a wide range of news categories to choose from, News Hub aims to deliver a seamless news browsing experience.

Upon landing on the website, users are greeted with a sleek and modern navbar prominently displayed at the top. This navbar serves as the gateway to different news categories, ensuring that you can quickly access the topics that interest you the most. Whether you're passionate about sports 	:basketball:, entertainment :dancer:, science :telescope:, technology :technologist:, or any other area, News Hub has you covered. Once you select a category from the navbar, News Hub swiftly loads the relevant news articles, keeping you up-to-date with the latest happenings in your chosen field.

To enhance user experience further, News Hub incorporates a loading spinner. This spinner provides visual feedback, assuring you that the news articles are being fetched and will be available shortly. The loading spinner appears when switching between categories or when new articles are being retrieved, ensuring that you're always aware of the data fetching process.

In addition to the loading spinner, News Hub features a top loader bar, which showcases a progress indicator as you scroll through news pages. This visual element enables you to keep track of your progress and provides a seamless scrolling experience.

To facilitate easy navigation between news pages, News Hub incorporates next and previous buttons located at the bottom of the page. By utilizing these buttons, you can effortlessly move between pages of news articles, ensuring that you don't miss out on any important updates.

News Hub is designed to keep you informed and engaged, with a clean and intuitive user interface that allows you to focus on the news articles themselves. With its attention to detail, efficient loading mechanisms, and convenient navigation features, News Hub is the ideal platform for those seeking a comprehensive and user-friendly daily news experience.
